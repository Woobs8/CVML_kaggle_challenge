# CVML Kaggle Challenge
Source code the in-class kaggle challenge for the course in Computer Vision and Machine Learning

## Models
Support Vector Machine (SVM): support for linear and traditional kernels (rbf, poly, sigmoid)
Fully-Connected Neural Network (FC): implement a dense (fully-connected) neural network with a softmax classifier

## Usage
The Training/ directory contains script for generating, training and evaluating the the models. Each script takes an output directory as an argument, in which it will place all output files.
